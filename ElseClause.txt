An else clause is an alternate ending to an if statement. If the if statement is false then the else clause will occur.
else clauses are used hand in hand with if statements
if(true) {
		print("yay!)
	}else {
		print("wrong");
	}
if statements and else clauses can both be used with math operators
an else clause allows for the function to run a different script if the primary function can't, or isn't able to run
else clauses, along with if statements, are referred to as conditionals
